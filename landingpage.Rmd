Hello world.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

tibs <- readxl::read_xlsx("BestoftheWorst/data/botw_all2.xlsx") %>% mutate(date = ymd_hms(date), vid_length = duration(duration))
```

Now we want to try adding a plot to our rmd file, checking that it gets added to our md file under the landingpage_files folder, then committing and pushing all that to github. 

```{r}

tibs %>% ggplot(aes(x = date, y = vid_length, color = subseries)) + geom_point()
                  

```
