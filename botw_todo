# TO-DO
# Expanding Dataset:
    # add columns: 
    #   non-panelists, readers/introducers, discussers, spinners, wheel videos, duration of discussion
    # New data frames:
    #   movie data (imdb links) + data on RLM's entire collection
# ANALYSIS & VISUALIZATION: 
# How do views over time compare to overall channel/other series (e.g. HITB, RE:View)?
      # Views change all the time so this part needs to be automatically updated 
# Transcript sentiment analysis: 
      # Time (across whole series but also within a given episode)
      # Panelists
      # Subseries 
      # Machine Learning: predict which movie wins/loses an episode based on transcript?  
      # Ranking episodes based on a given emotion (confusion, happiness, etc.)
# Panelists/Guests: 
    # Who leads discussion the most vs. their no. of appearances?
    # Who's the biggest contrarian?
    # Which movies did each pick?
    # Who picked the most winners/losers?
    # Map of host-to-panelist connections
# Movie Data: 
    # Which movies were discussed for the longest period of time?
    # After a movie appears in an episode, how does its IMDB rating change? 
    # Recurring names/companies & connections between films 
    # Which people had greatests discrepancy between the rating of what they appeared in on BOTW vs. their entire career?
        # My guess would be someone from Keaton's Cop or David Carradine or Denise Crosby or Dan Haggerty 
    # "Curse of the Worst" 
    # Wheel movies (no. of and order of appearances)
    # Ranking movies on series performance by genre and other tags (e.g. creature/monster movie)
# Ranking Episodes: 
  # Generate a ranking of all episodes based on user input 
  # Identify variables which predict a video's rank in this ordering 
# PUBLISHING
  # Neat, RMarkdown tutorial style write-up. 
  # Publish on blogdown personal website
